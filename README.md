# MultiTranslator

This multitool used translatr to automatically translate many keywords in multiple languages.

There is a need of a file named : Checks.txt to exist, in order to translate the keywords that this file contains.

The keywords must be splitted by a dot (.) or by line, or both

The output file is named LastResort.txt and contains [name of language]:[translation]. 

E.g French:manger
    Spanish:comer 
          ...
                                                                                            
The translations contain 92 languages and dialects. In LastResort.txt the translations for different keywords are sepetated by "\n-----------\n\n"

Actions to be made. 
Because many dialects are the same as other languages, maybe it would be wise to exclude the same-translated dialects.
